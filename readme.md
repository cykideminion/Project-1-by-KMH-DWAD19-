# A Glance of HDB Resale Market Price for 2022
The aim of this project is to allow users to easily visualize past HDB transactions without having trouble to look up the excel sheet. It is dedicated to researchers, real estate stakeholders as well as even ordinary users. Noticed that potential house buyers might have difficulties to look through the plain excel sheets of past transactions and in order to make their lives easier, this project have been created and implemented.

## UI/UX

- As of now, there is no available data dashboard for HDB resale prices in Singapore. And if anyone wants to find out the past transactions, all the available data are in just plane table format. Therefore, I have got the idea for this project to let various stakeholders easily visualize the data. 
- This project was implemented with target users from various backgrounds such as potential house buyers, researchers as well as other real estate stakeholders to understand the market prices.
- There are two main pages in this project. At the home page, there are 3 main sections where users can find the data related to past HDB transactions. The next page - Detail information - shows more breakdown detail data.
- This data dashboard is implemented with multiple options whereby users could customize the data and make comparisons to suit their desired customization.
- In order to ensure that the data dashboard is not another boring site, various types of eye-catching colors have been utilized accordingly.
